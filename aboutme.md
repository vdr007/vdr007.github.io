I enjoy building systems and my research interests lie in the area of
large-scale distributed system with a focus on consistency and scalability.
Previously, I was working on high performance computing with a focus on
optimizing communication in GPU accelerated clusters.

I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) from [The Ohio State University](http://www.osu.edu/)
in 2018 and my advisor was Professor [Yang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.7564/).
Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.ccse.uestc.edu.cn/)
from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
